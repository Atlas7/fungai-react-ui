A web app that does fun stuff with GitHub APIs, such as listing most popular repositories, and comparing two users, etc.

The output is based on the GitHub Battle Project originated from the new [ReactJS Fundmental course](tylermcginnis.com)
by [@tylermcginnis](https://github.com/tylermcginnis) - I did not "invent" this web app from scratch but this
does demonstrate the tech that I have worked with (and learnt from).

Notes:

- this app is not bullet proof - mainly used for educational / (my own) boiler-plate purposes. There are limitations.
- though I did write this app up from scratch, I did so by following through the ReactJS Fundamentals course.
All credits go to[@tylermcginnis](https://github.com/tylermcginnis) who created the course.
This work is not entirely my own!
- my development environment: Node v6.11, Mac OSX 10.11. I use nvm to create isolated NodeJS environment.
- the app is written in hybrid JavaScript ES5/ES6. There is an opportunity to turn it into full-blown ES6/ES7.

# Instruction

To run this app on your laptop (I used a Mac) do the followings:

## Clone Repository

git clone this repository to an appropriate location on your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Atlas7/react-github-battle-2017.git
```


## Install NPM Dependencies

Navigate to the root level of the repository.

Install NPM dependencies:

```
npm install
```


## Manually Setup GitHub API Access ID and Secret

At the root level of the repository, manually create a folder called `secrets`
(this folder is included in `.gitignore` to avoid accidentally exposing your GitHub API access credentials):

```
mkdir secrets
```

Manually create a file called `githubAPIConfig.js` within this `secrets` directory:

```
touch secrets/githubAPIConfig.js
```

Populate the content of this `githubAPIConfig.js` like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  id: "YOUR-GITHUB-API-ID",
  secret: "YOUT-GITHUB-API-SECRET"
}
```

Replace the string values for `id` and `secret` accordingly. You need to register an app that uses the GitHub API. 
Use the GitHub [Register a new OAuth Application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) to register your
application and obtain a new pair of GitHub API ID and Secret. I completed the fields like this:

```
Application Name: react-github-battle-2017

Homepage URL: http://localhost:8080

Application Description: A web app that does fun stuff with GitHub APIs, such as listing most popular repositories,
and comparing two users, etc..

Authorization callback URL: http://localhost:8080/callback
```

Once you have registered your app with GitHub you can retrieve your GitHub API ID and Secrets easily by going to your 
GitHub Profile -> Settings -> OAuth Applications -> Developer Applications -> github-battle (or whatever the app name 
you have registered with GitHub API).

## Run the App in development mode

```
npm run start
```

Navigate via a browser (I use Chrome Incognito) at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) - yay the app
should be live!

(hosted by webpack-dev-server - essentially referencing `app/index.html` and `app/index.js`
(non-minimized development version).


## Build the App for production deployment

```
npm run build
```

This will update `dist/index.html` and `dist/index_bundle.js` (minimized production version) - essentially your
core web app production files.

Open the actual `dist/index.html` file (via Mac Finder) to start playing with the single page web app!

Note: To build the non-minimized version bundled files, do this instead (not used often)):

```
npm run build-dev
```

## Deploy to Firebase

### One off Firebase config

Create a new project on [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) with a gmail / google account.

Do the following to configure Firebase:

```
npm run firebase-init
```

Complete fields:

```
You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /Users/johnny/repos/react-github-battle-2017

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing in an existing Firebase project directory

? Which Firebase CLI features do you want to setup for this folder? Press Space to select features, then Enter to confirm your choices. Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: react-github-battle-2017 (react-github-battle-2017)

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? dist
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
? File dist/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No
i  Skipping write of dist/index.html

i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...
i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...

✔  Firebase initialization complete!
```

### Continual Firebase deployment

```
npm run build && firebase deploy
```

You may see this in the console:

```
(some build messages...)

=== Deploying to 'react-github-battle-2017'...

i  deploying hosting
i  hosting: preparing dist directory for upload...
✔  hosting: 2 files uploaded successfully

✔  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/react-github-battle-2017/overview
Hosting URL: https://react-github-battle-2017.firebaseapp.com
